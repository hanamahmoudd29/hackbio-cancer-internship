# Introduction
 Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are highly vulnerable to bacterial and fungal infections, which are a leading cause of illness and mortality. Antimicrobial resistance poses a major threat to their health, with multi-drug resistance causing significant problems for hospitalised patients, as well as those with weakened immune systems (Worku et al.,2022).

# Cancer patients' risk factors for antibiotic resistance
 The majority of antibiotic resistance risk factors are seen in the non-immunosuppressed general population. The majority of problematic patients with MDR organism infections require long hospital stays and treatment with antibiotics. Risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in cancer patients include various multidrug-resistant infections. In general, the following list comprises the most significant risk factors for resistance development: Invasive infection, severe illness, prolonged hospitalisation, urinary catheterization, intensive care unit stay and past exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics (Gudiol & Carratalà, 2014).  
 
# Antibiotic-Resistance Surveillance Systems for Cancer patients
  Surveillance is analysis of health data necessary for organising public health practices. Different nations have created their own protocols for monitoring microorganisms resistant to antibiotics. These findings empower physicians to offer significant interventions aimed at reducing the impact of antibiotic resistance, in conjunction with clinical and demographic data collected from patients. Surveillance data can be utilised to create prediction models for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial diseases that are clinically relevant. Based on factors including patient age and past antibiotic use, Gudiol et al. created a clinical prediction model in 2020 that is accessible online and can be used to identify cancer patients who are neutropenic and at high risk of bloodstream infections due to MDR P. aeruginosa. This suggests that the model could help these patients by enhancing the way that targeted empirical antibiotic treatment is administered (Nanayakkara et al., 2021).
  
# Case study
  An investigation conducted in 2015 discovered that hospital-acquired infections were the cause of 58 out of 282 deaths among cancer patients who needed critical care. An MDR pathogen was found in 51 of the 58 cases. When microorganisms from patients admitted to the intensive care unit were collected, the total prevalence of MDR pathogens was close to 40%. Of the pathogens that were found to be multidrug resistant (MDR), 20% were caused by E. Coli, 12% by S. Aureus, 12% by E. faecium and 6% by A. baumannii (Nanayakkara et al., 2021).

# Conclusion
  To effectively treat antibiotic resistance and handle health issues for cancer patients, antimicrobial resistance needs preventive measures for dose and usage, as well as resistance pattern research and surveillance.
