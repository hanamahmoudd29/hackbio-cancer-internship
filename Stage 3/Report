## AMR Phase
### Role of the AMR Epidemiologists:
AMR epidemiologists led the analysis of the raw cholera epidemic data. They uncovered necessary trends, such as significant outbreaks, and developed creative visuals that illustrate the intensity, spread, and effect of cholera outbreaks over the years. They created useful graphs that show the global distribution of cholera cases and fatalities across various countries, using data from 1949 onwards. This data enabled them to pinpoint significant outbreaks, such as the 1991 pandemic in Peru and the cholera resurgence in Haiti in 2010. These findings served as the foundation for the visualizations embedded into the Shiny dashboard.
In addition, the epidemiologists created a half-page summary template for reporting cholera outbreak data in countries individually. This template featured important parameters like the number of reported cases, fatalities, and long-term trends in outbreak severity. This template was significant in ensuring that the dashboard could automatically generate country-specific reports in a systematic and uniform manner.

Frontend Bioinformatic Phase
In this assignment, our team of two AMR epidemiologists and five front-end bioinformaticians collaborated to create a Shiny app that improves the visual representation and reporting of cholera epidemic data collected from the World Health Organization. Our major goal was to design an accessible and interactive dashboard that could be used to show global cholera epidemic data as well as provide detailed summaries and reports for individual countries.
Role of the Front-End Bioinformaticians:
The interactive dashboard was developed by the front-end bioinformaticians using R Shiny. The dashboard includes a variety of functionality that make data more accessible and actionable. The key aspects are as follows:
• Interactive Maps and Charts: The dashboard illustrates cholera cases and fatalities over time using global and country-specific data, with interactive maps and charts. These visualizations incorporate interactive maps that allow users to investigate cholera cases in various geographic locations.
• Filters: Filter data by country and timeframe to focus on specific outbreaks or trends.
• Automatic Report Generation: Automatic report generation based on epidemiologists' summary templates is a notable feature. Users can select a country and the dashboard will immediately provide a thorough summary report on cholera outbreaks, highlighting significant trends and indicators.
In a broader sense the application not only functions as a data visualization tool, but it also provides useful insights about global cholera epidemics. The team established a formidable resource for understanding and managing cholera epidemics around the world by combining epidemiological expertise and bioinformatics skills.
